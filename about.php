    <h2>About me</h2>
      
      <p>My name is Karina Engelbrecht and I am a trained medical examiner, a RAB-registered therapist and an active member of Denmark's complementary therapists in the Dakobe association.</p>
      
      <p>On a daily basis I am working as a masseur at Chiropractor Frank Hansen in Dronninglund and at my own private clinic in Pandrup. Currently, I am also a fitness instructor in PGU Training and Fitness in the Jetsmark Sports Center. In addition, I am a graduate of DGI in step, aerobics and muscle training. </p>
    
      <p>Living an active, hustling lifestyle is crucial for me, just as much as learning and developing on my field to provide the best and up-to-date service for my patients. Thatâ€™s why I regularly attend further courses at Lasota Therapy Academy where I get updated regarding therapies and first aid.
