        <h2>Cupping therapy</h2>
        <p>Cupping therapy is a traditional Chinese treatment for various health conditions such as pain relief, sport recovery and skin conditions.
            It is a great supplement to massage which increases the elasticity of the muscles, pulls toxins out of the connective tissue and releases relaxin. In this treatment, bruising may occur. The treatment is very good for hypertension / muscle tension.
        </p>


        <h3>How it works</h3>

        <p>During this therapy circular cups are attached to the patient&#39;s skin where suction is created by heating the cup inside (which creates vacuum)/ using a handheld pump.
Thanks to the suction, the skin is pulled upwards into the cup that increases blood flow to the area which, in turn, reduces muscle tension and inflammation, and promotes healing.
